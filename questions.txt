1. LastPlayBot required me to add another method to the Player class. Once I did this I simply saved the opponents move using this method.

2. I wanted my bot to be able to defeat amateur players and be able to trick people. To accomplish this I made the first play always be scissors to beat rock openings. Then, I play the move that beats the opponents next move assuming he plays the game in order like most amateurs do.

3. Java's primitive types are assigned size at binding time. Java is statically typed because you must declare a type in advance before assigning to it. Because Java is statically typed it is considered a strongly typed language because it has stricter rules at compile time. Java allows user defined types to be used for increased functionality and OO ability. I knew this information from lecture!

4. After a number of games, I find it hardest to beat the random bot. It is the best at beating any of the bots because of it's unpredictability. All the other bots I can beat on a regular basis.

5. Because rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock is a normal form game with equal outcomes there is no mathematical way of making a bot succeed. The only way to possibly gain an advantage is to assume something about the other player. Using my bot, noobs will most likely be beaten because I am assuming noobs are playing my game.

6. I enjoy Java's integration with android programming as it is useful for quickly making apps. Other than this use and possibly JavaScript I won't be using Java.

7. I absolutely hate static typing. After python, there is no going back to Java because of the added repetition.

8. Yes, it was a fun exercise to use OO programming and make a game.

10. I have taken two Java courses and have used it in my free time.
